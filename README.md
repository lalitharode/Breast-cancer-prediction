# Breast-cancer-prediction

## Overview

The project aims to provide a valuable tool for early detection and diagnosis of cancer, which can have a significant impact on patient outcomes. The predictive model is built using a diverse set of features, allowing it to make informed decisions regarding cancer diagnosis.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a comprehensive cancer dataset, which includes various attributes related to patients' medical records. These attributes encompass clinical and imaging data, and they are instrumental in training and evaluating the machine learning model. The dataset is available for download and exploration.

## Machine Learning Techniques

The predictive model employs a Logistic regression, Decision tree. This classifier is well-suited for cancer prediction tasks, as it can handle complex relationships in the data and provide robust predictions. The model has been trained and fine-tuned to maximize accuracy and minimize false positives/negatives.


## Results

The model's performance has been rigorously evaluated using a separate test dataset, and the results are presented in the project report. The model exhibits high accuracy and has the potential to assist medical professionals in diagnosing cancer accurately.
